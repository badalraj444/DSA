// Thought for 32s

// Nice — great code and a great instinct (that dp[0] = true is essential!). Below I’ll unpack the idea, show why the backward loop is critical, give a short correctness sketch, and visualize the boolean dp array step-by-step for concrete inputs so you can see the pattern.

// Intuition — what dp represents

// Think of dp as the set of sums you can make with the numbers seen so far.

// dp[s] == true means: there exists a subset of the processed prefix of nums whose sum is exactly s.

// Start with {0} (only sum 0 is possible): dp[0] = true.

// When you see a new number x, you produce new sums by adding x to every sum already reachable. That is: newReachable = oldReachable ∪ (oldReachable + x).

// The code implements this set union in-place with a boolean array. The operation dp[s] = dp[s] || dp[s-x] says: sum s is reachable now if it was already reachable, or if s-x was reachable before we used x.

// Key logic points (why each line matters)

// if (sum & 1) return false; → quick rejection when total odd.

// target = sum/2 → we only care about sums up to target (any sum > target can be ignored).

// dp[0] = true → base case: empty subset sums to 0.

// for (int reachable = target; reachable >= n; reachable--) → iterate backwards! This prevents using the same number multiple times in the same iteration.

// dp[reachable] = dp[reachable - n]; (or equivalently dp[reachable] = dp[reachable] || dp[reachable-n];) → this shifts the set of reachable sums by n and unions it with the existing set.

// if (dp[target]) return true; → early exit as soon as we can make target.

// Why iterate backwards? (the crucial bit)

// If you iterate forwards (from small sums to large), you risk using the same number multiple times during one pass. Example idea:

// Suppose dp[0] = true, n = 3, and target >= 6.

// Forward loop:

// when s = 3: dp[3] = dp[3] || dp[0] sets dp[3] = true.

// later in same pass when s = 6: dp[6] = dp[6] || dp[3] — but dp[3] was set this same iteration, so it uses the same 3 twice (incorrect).

// Backward iteration ensures when you compute dp[s] you only read dp[s-n] from the previous state (not something set in the current number’s pass).

// Correctness (short induction)

// Invariant: after processing the first k items, dp[s] is true iff some subset of those k items sums to s.

// Base: k=0 → only dp[0]=true.

// Step: processing x extends every previously reachable sum r to r+x. Doing the backward loop updates dp[s] from dp[s-x] of the previous state, so the invariant holds.

// Complexity

// Time: O(n * target) where target = sum/2.

// Space: O(target) (use vector<bool> or vector<char>).
// (You can allocate dp as target+1 instead of sum+1 to save memory.)
